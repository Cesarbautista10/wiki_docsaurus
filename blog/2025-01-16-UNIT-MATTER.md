UNIT Matter IoT Line implenting ESP32C6.

<!-- truncate -->


## Introduction


UNIT Matter IoT Line is a series of development boards based on the ESP32-C6 microcontroller. The ESP32-C6 is a highly integrated Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) SoC with a dual-core CPU, designed for IoT applications. The Matter IoT Line boards are designed to provide a simple and cost-effective solution for developing IoT devices that are compatible with the Matter protocol.


Matter connectivity is a new open-source standard for smart home devices, developed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA). It aims to provide a unified and secure way for smart home devices to communicate with each other, regardless of the manufacturer or communication protocol. The Matter protocol is based on IP and is designed to work over Wi-Fi, Thread, and Ethernet networks.

## First Results 

For the new desing development board, we have the first results of the new ESP32-C6 microcontroller. The new ESP32-C6 is a highly integrated Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) SoC with a dual-core CPU, designed for IoT applications. The ESP32-C6 is based on the RISC-V architecture and features a dual-core CPU with a clock speed of up to 160 MHz. The ESP32-C6 also features a rich set of peripherals, including UART, SPI, I2C, I2S, PWM, and ADC interfaces, as well as a built-in temperature sensor and a security accelerator.
